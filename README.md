A 16MB RAM upgrade for Acorn A3000 machines.  Two PALs (IC39,IC71) are copies of those from the A540.

The first spin of the design has been built and tested, with some design errors and PCB-level errors noted, though proven functional and reliable under regular use and under memory stress test situations.

The updated/corrected design has not yet been built or tested.
