This is an UNFINISHED Work-in-progress implementation of a 16MB RAM upgrade for Acorn A3000 machines.
It will require two PALs to be lifted/copied from the A540 - work in progress to create implementations to program in to new parts.
This is currently essentially no more than a "progressed idea" with lots still to do!
